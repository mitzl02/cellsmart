<p>     There are two types of installation, new installation and old installation. New installation is very simple just follow the steps otherwise for the old installation
            For old installation - follow every step however once you login to the dropbox - go to the dropbox folder and copy the last file saved in the drop box folder --- the name of the file should be cspxxx_saturday_2023
            Copy the file and  thne go to store database folder and then rename the store database file to storedatabase 0 and the paste the latest file which we copied from the dropbox and then rename it to storedatabase with S in store and D in database should be capital
    </p>

90% issues for the 2.0 is very simple, let's say customer is getting runtime error then simply take control of the pc by teamviewer - open the storedatabase file in the c drive and then go to menu at the top - MANAGE - compact and repair database (keep and eye while doing these on the bottom right side where it shows time and data it would show progress bar if its complete then only store database file ortherwise don't close once done go to the dropbox and then go to cell smart pos update file - new update and then manually update the pos ) -- by doing this 80-90% issue will get fixed.
